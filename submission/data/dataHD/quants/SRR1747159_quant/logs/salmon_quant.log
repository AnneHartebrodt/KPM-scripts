[2018-11-07 03:09:59.247] [jointLog] [info] Counted 43,147,555 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-11-07 03:09:59.250] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0471086% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 1.
